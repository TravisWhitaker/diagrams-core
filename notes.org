Notes on updating to use semidirect product

Next step is to figure out how to make an appropriate

  instance Action (Semi Style Transformation) Query

Not sure what the right theoretical basis for this is.  Note Style is
not supposed to have any action on Query so basically this is about
making the Transformation act.

So maybe the right solution is to just change the code that supposedly
needs this instance to instead project out the Transformation and have
it act?  Hmm, no, it's embedded rather deeply in the guts of DTRee.

At this point maybe just forget about this, since we'll be totally
overhauling it anyway.
